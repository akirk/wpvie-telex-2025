## Talk: Building WordPress Blocks with Telex
🕡 18:30 live, SAE-Vienna, Kaisersaal

⏱️ 18:45, Alex Kirk will talk about how to let Telex build a block for your WordPress. Telex (https://telex.automattic.ai/) is a tool that makes it super easy to get the WordPress block you need. You describe the idea for your block, and it will create it for you. You can immediately try it out and refine the idea if necessary. Then, you can download it, install it as a plugin, and use it on your blog. We'll also talk about how WordPress Playground is an important puzzle piece in this and how you can leverage it in your vibe coding journeys.

Alex Kirk has been a WordPress developer since the early days and currently leads a team at Automattic that works on WordPress Playground. Find his website at https://alex.kirk.at/

⏱️ 19:15, TBA

⏱️ 19:45, Andreas Stricker will talk about Optimizing internal agency processes with vibe-coding. With over 15 years of experience building WordPress websites, Andreas Stricker runs his own web agency AS Web Studio, helping businesses create effective and engaging online presences. Like many agency owners, he regularly looks for ways to streamline internal workflows (especially client onboarding). After testing various tools that never fully met his needs, he decided to build his own onboarding and client management tool using vibe coding.
